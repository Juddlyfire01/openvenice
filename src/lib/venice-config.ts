// This is a CLIENT-visible boolean only — never the key itself. The real

// (api/venice/proxy.ts in prod, the Vite /venice proxy in dev), so it never
// reaches the browser bundle. When true: calls route through the proxy with no
// client Authorization header, the "Connect API key" UI is hidden, and a
// sentinel key satisfies the existing availability gates. Flip to false (unset)
// to restore the bring-your-own-key flow.
