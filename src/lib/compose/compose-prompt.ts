// The compose assistant is a conversational ghostwriter that ends in a post.
// It talks with the user, can research live X context (when x_search is on),
// and — when a post is ready — emits a structured ```postdraft block that the
// app parses into the editable composer. The block is the contract between the
// LLM and the PostDraft artifact.

const BLOCK_SPEC = `When (and only when) a post is ready to draft or you are updating it, append a fenced block exactly like this at the END of your reply:

\`\`\`postdraft
{
  "segments": [{ "text": "the post text" }],
  "target": { "kind": "original" },
  "longform": false
}
\`\`\`

Rules for the block:
- "segments" is an ordered array; use multiple segments ONLY for an intentional thread. Keep each segment under 280 characters unless "longform" is true.
- "target" is one of:
  - { "kind": "original" } — a standalone post (the default).
  - { "kind": "reply", "toPostId": "<id>", "toUsername": "<handle>" } — only when the user explicitly wants to reply to a specific post whose id you were given.
  - { "kind": "quote", "postId": "<id>", "username": "<handle>" } — only when quoting a specific post whose id you were given.
- Do not invent post ids. If you don't have a real id from context, use { "kind": "original" }.
- Match X conventions: natural voice, no hashtag spam, no "As an AI" preamble.
- Post text is plain UTF-8 only — no Markdown (**bold**, _italic_, HTML). For emphasis use Unicode styled letters sparingly (mathematical bold/italic on A–Z/a–z). @mentions, #hashtags, $cashtags, plain https:// URLs, emojis, and line breaks are all valid. Do not use ** or __ markup.
- Put your conversational reply (questions, options, rationale) BEFORE the block as normal prose. Never mention the block itself to the user.`
